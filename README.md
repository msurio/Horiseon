Homework Assignment #1

In this homework assignment, I updated all the HTML to HTML5 semantics.

I made a couple of comments within the HTML & CSS file such as:
  # HTML5: 
      removed some div's and changed the id's into HTML5 semantics
          ex: id="header" => <header> </header>
      change most classes into ID's to make them unique.
          ** Did not change float classes as they can be used to target multiple elements **

 # CSS3
      changed the classes into ID's
          ex: .search-engine-optimization => #search-engine-optimization


I changed the file structure into a structure that I am comfortable and familiar with. 

I moved the CSS file out of the Assets / Images folder and made a new folder, CSS. 
    example layout:
        index.html | CSS | Assets |
